# VigenereCipher
The VigenereCipher class provides an implementation of the Vigen√®re cipher, a method of encrypting and decrypting text using a series of different Caesar ciphers based on a keyword. The class includes various constructors, methods for encryption and decryption, and a method to print the cipher's dictionary.

The project is heavily inspired by a video created by YouTuber LEMINO. I thoroughly enjoy his content, especially this video. I suggest you watch the [Video](https://youtu.be/jVpsLMCIB0Y?si=haevvMONuUgkI6_0) yourself. 

# How it Works
First, a keyword (referred to as a dictionary key) is chosen to populate the beginning of a standard English alphabet. It is important to note that this preappended word is a rearrangement of the existing letters rather than an addition of new characters. In other words, the letters are reformatted so that the keyword appears at the front of the alphabet. I reffer to this new mutation of the alphabet as the Base Alphabet. This Base Alphabet will define the dictionary we use to encode characters. 

For example, if KRYPTOS is the keyword, the resulting base alphabet would be as follows: "KRYPTOSABCDEFGHIJLMNQUVWXZ". 

Next, this base alphabet is used to create an encryption table, which we refer to as the dictionary. The base alphabet is reformatted so that the first letter of the alphabet is appended to the end of the dictionary, and this process is repeated for every character. The result is a 26 x 26 dictionary we use to encode desired text.

# How to encode plaintext
Now that we have our dictionary set up and our keystream prepared, we can start encoding. First, we choose our desired plaintext, which will define our horizontal movement during the encoding process. Let our plaintext be the phrase 'Impossible is a word to be found only in the dictionary of fools.' Next, we need to adjust our keystream so that its length matches the plaintext. In this case, our plaintext contains 49 characters, so our goal is to have a keystream of the same length. There are many ways to adjust a keystream; you can even create an algorithm yourself to reformat your keystream. The approach I will use is to simply re-append the letters of the keystream (in order) until the desired length is obtained. Any special characters will be ignored. For example, the keystream in our case will be reformatted to "LEMONLEMON LE M ONLE MO NL EMONL EMON LE MON LEMONLEMON LE MONLE".
