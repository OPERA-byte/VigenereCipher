# VigenereCipher
The VigenereCipher class provides an implementation of the Vigen√®re cipher, a method of encrypting and decrypting text using a series of different Caesar ciphers based on a keyword. The class includes various constructors, methods for encryption and decryption, and a method to print the cipher's dictionary.

The project is heavily inspired by a video created by YouTuber LEMINO. I thoroughly enjoy his content, especially this video. I suggest you watch the [Video](https://youtu.be/jVpsLMCIB0Y?si=haevvMONuUgkI6_0) yourself.
